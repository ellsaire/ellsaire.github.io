<b>the anatomy of a <span style="color:deepskyblue">house</span></b><br>
houses don’t die easily. they just wait.<br><br>

their roots soak themselves in the saline, the aerated, the unclean. inundated by the wounds of their <br>inhabitants.<br><br>

those inhabitants can move on. the house cannot.<br><br>

at one point or another, a house’s roots become saturated and full. unable to continue their absorption.<br><br>

the tears, the blood, and the bile begin to overflow back into the house itself. <br><br>

it cannot move away. it cannot leave. it cannot wash itself clean. <br><br>

it must live with our strife and negligence long after we have rid ourselves of it. this contagion, this <br>pollution, erodes the walls of the house from the inside.<br><br>

each time a new family takes residence within, the weight bearing down on a house multiplies. this <br>family’s burdens worsen the affliction. quicken the cancer.<br><br>

eventually, a house can no longer hear its own groaning and creaking, so clogged is it with our suffering. <br>clotted with our tears. its sense of self drowns in our selfish misery.<br><br>

this is when a house turns to malice. <br>

it becomes difficult to navigate. it locks doors, seals rooms, and winds in on itself. the illness overflows <br>into its spaces. memories long since forgotten begin to manifest. <br><br>

old storage boxes draw attention to themselves. <br><br>

the house lures the inhabitants into their own pasts. if it must so completely soak in its history, then<br> so must we.<br><br>

when a house has fully ensnared the mind within its own cacophony, asphyxiating it with just an ounce of <br>the bloat it suffers while it drags towards slow, distant death,<br><br>

it begins to turn the lights out.<br><br>

we move away. we know when we are unwelcome. <br><br>

but unoccupied spaces must find something to fill them.
