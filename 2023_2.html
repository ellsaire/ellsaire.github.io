<b>Family Weekend/homecoming</b><br>
Youâ€™re not fooling anyone.<br><br>

Under that skin lies nothing but yellowed, hollow bone and cotton-candy insulation. <br>
That breath smells of sopping, long-dead cod. <br><br>

Your sanded-away blemishes, those bursting pustules replaced by already-clotted blood, do not hide <br>
anything. We can still see your sagging, infirmed cheekbones. Everybody can.<br><br>

The approximation of a face is better, this time, but the eyebrows are all wrong. The jaw is <br>misaligned. Arms do not bend like that.<br><br>

Those legs will not go further than this afternoon and we all know that so why do you play pretend? <br>
No one will carry you when this collapses, so <br>
Get back down on your knees and crawl. <br><br>

That body was not made for walking.
