<b>maelstrom</b><br>

the maelstroms are becoming more frequent. louder.<br><br>

they put on their production, their wild-eyed babbling; scrambling over the earth, lurching and leaping <br>and clawing, insisting on our attention.<br><br>

the land is left lacerated and bruised and tired. its breathing is labored and the air is thin, used up and <br>worn out from the frenzied mania.<br><br>

it begins the slow process of collecting itself, and then another maelstrom arrives.<br><br>

its raving gouges the ground, awakens geysers of dirt and filth, cyclones of shorn houses and fractured <br>grandeur. our cities have been ripped asunder like playthings of some aberrant Godchild left too long in <br>daddy’s office unsupervised.<br><br>

each one’s whirling hysteria brings the land further and further beyond recognition. soon, there may be <br>nothing of us which remains; our golden, indomitable paradise rendered nothing more than a brittle shell <br>shattered on some jagged summit.<br><br>

it is bloodletting for the sake of bloodletting. incomprehensible force used with no justification other than <br>its own existence.<br><br>

we build our houses low to the ground, now. slow ourselves to the pace the tempests demand of us. <br>some have started to live in the mountains, hiding within the earth. this, too, is folly. <br><br>

what is to stop a storm from simply shearing a mountain in two?
