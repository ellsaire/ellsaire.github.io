<b>coming home</b><br><br>

going home is the echo after a shout, the wind slipping in through the sunroof, tousling your hair, the <br>lingering warmth of a deep hug. going home is wonderful.<br><br>

it’s the coming home that will get you.<br><br>

the wind is halted and everything is silent and still, the stainless sheen of a renovated kitchen sullied by your <br>reflection, disturbed by your hunger.<br><br>

when you forget to take your shoes off, you track in dirt. the creaks of the stairs remind of your <br>inattention, your apathy, your trepidatious footsteps tremendous in a place like this, everything put perfect<br>
in its place <br><br>

except you.<br><br>

the door now a half-inch open, cool air slowly replaced by the hot, exhausted rot that must stay outside.<br><br>

distrust appears out of annoyance, and malevolence follows soon after.<br><br>

every move is questioned, every window opened blinding, every floorboard rougher, every little sound of <br>skin brushing against skin deafening.<br><br>


try and be still, for once. it cannot be as hard as you seem to think.<br><br>


the front door becomes heavier each time you go out, shutting before you’re halfway through, holding <br>that fleshy, tangled, bloody mess hostage until you inevitably end up<br><br>

coming back home.
