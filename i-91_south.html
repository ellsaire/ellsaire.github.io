<b>I-91 South</b><br>
Been seeing <br>
lighthouses, lately. <br>
More than a normal amount of <br>
lighthouses’,<br>
I guess.<br><br>

There’s<br>
nothing to illuminate<br>
but August-dry stalks, bathed <br>
in tinnitic, sanguinary wind. charcoal<br>
ed crops don’t do much, under fluorescence.<br>
My sunhat doesn’t neither.<br>
Not that I’m getting<br>
burnt. Doctor,<br><br>

Harvest season’s<br>
on it’s way, <br>
Doc say’s.<br><br>

the grand Interior’s<br>
now ready for <br>
its grander <br>
Deflowering.<br>
Not that flowers <br>
have anything to do with it.<br><br>

One wonders what a lighthouse is doing there.<br><br>

I think I am beginning to know.<br>
This thing we’re still<br>
calling a squall<br>
hasn’t <br>
stopped for a<br>
Good long while, now.<br>
Cartilage peeks out, behind the eyes.<br><br>

NNNNNNNNNot that cartilage<br>
a bug sheds its skin; graft<br>
it back on please Doc<br>
HHHHHHHas <br>
anything <br>
to do <br>
with <br>
it.<br>
The sky<br>
Encroaches,<br>
Or recoils revuls<br>
ive, its clouds like lungs<br>
clogged with edema; pulmonar<br>
ily pregnant mothers far past due. Doc, <br>
why do the lighthouses Doc, why are the li<br>
ghthouses searching so fitfully? Their light is<br>
Oh So Very Difficult to find in this poor weather. Th<br>
ese eyes betray, grunged with rain and spoils. No need f<br>
or eyedrops now. Doc, I think the sun is ashamed, or grieving;<br>
she hasn’t shown her face in Harvest season’s nearly here, say’s<br>
Doc. Oh; Let me just take a shower before it comes in. I do not want it to<br>
And it all floods in as the heavens crack upon a lighthouse’s steeple, too-pointed, <br>
arrogant, and, for a moment, we are all equal, terrified and accepting under <br>
the terrible crash of Ordinance. Lungs avalanche through ribs eternal.<br>
Death has exchanged his horse for a surfboard and he rides the<br>
foamed edge of his bellowing wave as the Earth collapses,<br>
culling all he can. He bawls through the cacophony; in <br>
the mi(d)st of cataclysm, perhaps there is fun to be<br>
found. Ohh, oh; The distance between your bed<br>
and bath has become so great. I think this tor<br>
rent washes itself. Phlegm-wreathed he<br>
morrhage and accelerated erosion.<br>
Snowfall and forest swaddled,<br>
land drawn and quartered;<br>
maize and rapeseed<br>
finally reaped,<br>
a molting<br>
world<br>
with<br>
no<br>
Doc<br>
to graft<br>
it back on.<br>
I think it’s time <br>
for us, too, to molt,<br>
      and harvest. This<br>
               new helix of<br>
                     stars beck<br>
                             ons bas<br>
                                     hfu<br>
