<b>cathedrals to Capital</b><br><br>

The sun will glide across golden domes,<br>
alight on spires and linger on towers, <br>
dance lazily atop the waves before you.<br><br>

The river will be perfectly rippled, waves lulling, drifting, <br>
and the sky will be burnt and golden, <br>
light blooming out of God-shaped clouds.<br><br>

Cathedrals will catch your gaze, hold it, and out of focus, <br>
the city will sprawl infinite.<br><br>

Winding staircases and rooftop capers will fill your days, drink and grapes and luxury, <br>
the slender wind keeping the space between the sheets and your bodies just cool enough<br><br>

in Capital.<br><br>

The river rapture runs into this place, but not out. It is at once the journey and the destination; it is where <br>you should have begun and it is where you will end.<br><br>

Your ending is its beginning and as such it will remain in perpetuity, for you, for yours, for ours.
